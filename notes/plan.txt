# Plan #
## Finish first iteration of feature extraction code ##
    The features we plan to start with are small cuts of frequency space data over time, interpolated in 2D space between the sensors.

    The neural net architecture will be a variation on the idea of lstms over convnets.

    Concretely, we intend to experiment with different configurations of

    The second thing we intend to fit is raw signal ove
