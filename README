*./bin/deep_meg* points to ROOT_actual_work.py, which is where the project
starts.

The program starts by parsing the command line arguments, and by then checking
in *./ds_transform_saves* if there are any pickled versions of the features
with corresponding feature generation arguments. Currently, we use joblib.dump
to make the saves, as we found that that was a fairly fast method to save and
load
